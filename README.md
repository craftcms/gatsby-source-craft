<h1 align="center">Gatsby source plugin for Craft CMS</h1>

This Gatsby source plugin provides an integration with [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com). It uses Craft’s [GraphQL API](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/graphql.html) to make content within Craft available to Gatsby-powered front ends.

It requires for the corresponding [Gatsby Craft plugin](https://github.com/craftcms/craft-gatsby) to be installed on the Craft site.

This plugins sources the data from a Craft installation. On initial run, the entire site is sourced, while on subsequent runs, only delta changes are applied, significantly reducing build time.

If anything that gets written to the project config has changed, the entire site is sourced again.
